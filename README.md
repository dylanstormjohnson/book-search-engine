## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project to gain a better understanding of Apollo, MongoDB, Mongoose, and React.  It was built because I wanted to convert a restful API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  It is intended to solve the problem of routing with Apollo and GraphQL.  In making said project, I learned a lot about client and server routing and connectivity.
